/**
 * Wires the vendored Sanity repository to this site's environment. Mirrors
 * apps/web/lib/sanity-client.ts + repositories.ts in myridesg-v2, minus the
 * Next-specific parts (no `server-only`, no lazy Proxy — a static build reads
 * env once, at build time, and there is no request to defer to).
 *
 * Env vars — the v2 names without the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix, which only meant
 * something to Next. Set them in .env for local work, or in the build
 * environment for a deploy. See .env.example.
 *
 *   SANITY_PROJECT_ID      required   v2: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID
 *   SANITY_DATASET         required   v2: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET
 *   SANITY_API_VERSION     optional   defaults to the v2 pin below
 *   SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN  optional   only for a private dataset or drafts
 *
 * Sanity is OPTIONAL. With nothing configured the build still succeeds and
 * /guides renders its empty state — preview deploys and fresh checkouts are
 * first-class, exactly as they are in the monorepo.
