/**
 * VENDORED from myridesg-v2 @ packages/data/src/sanity/content-repository.ts.
 *
 * The GROQ is copied verbatim apart from two projections. Keep it that way — if
 * a query drifts, the two sites start disagreeing about what a guide is.
 *
 *   1. No image projections, which this site does not map (see ./mappers.ts).
 *   2. `body[]` dereferences the references inside a `relatedLinks` block to
 *      { slug, title, category }. Unprojected they arrive as bare _ref strings
 *      and the block cannot render a link, which is exactly the state v2 is in:
 *      packages/ui/src/patterns/PortableBody.tsx passes `slugs={[]}` under a
 *      TODO saying this projection is what it needs. Neither of these changes
 *      which documents are guides or how they are ordered — the two sites still
 *      agree about that — but the fix is worth porting back to the monorepo.
 *
 * The monorepo's `next: { tags: [...] }` fetch options are gone: those drive
 * Next's on-demand revalidation, and there is no server here to revalidate. A
 * rebuild is how this site picks up new content.
