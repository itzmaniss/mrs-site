  // Content Security Policy. Astro hashes every inline script and style it
  // emits and writes them into a <meta http-equiv> on each page. That is the
  // only mechanism that works here: the site has no external script files at
  // all — every script is small enough that Astro inlines it into the document
  // — so a fixed `script-src 'self'` header would block the theme toggle, the
  // menu and the scroll handler, and a hand-maintained hash list would go stale
  // on the next build.
  //
  // The site loads nothing off-origin: images come from astro:assets, fonts are
  // @fontsource (bundled), and Sanity is read at build time only. Hence 'self'
  // everywhere and 'none' for the things nothing uses — there are no forms, no
  // fetch calls, no workers and no manifest.
  //
  // Two directives a <meta> CSP cannot carry — frame-ancestors, which every
  // browser ignores there, and HSTS, which is not CSP at all — live in
  // config/nginx.conf and public/_headers instead. Keep those in sync with this.

  // No React. Nothing on the site is an island — the accordions and the menu
  // are <details>, the theme toggle and the phone screens are .astro — and the
  // integration emitted a ~190 KB client runtime into dist/_astro/ that no page
  // ever referenced. Add it back the day something genuinely needs it:
  //
  //   pnpm add @astrojs/react react react-dom
  //   pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom
  //
  // then re-add react() here and the jsx options to tsconfig.json. Note that
  // the feat/demo branch DOES have an island (DemoGarage.tsx), so it needs all
  // of the above restored before it can build against this config.

  // on every build. Prism emits class names instead, so the warning goes and a
