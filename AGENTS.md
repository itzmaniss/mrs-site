# MyRideSG — marketing site

Standalone marketing and content site for MyRideSG, split out of the
`myridesg-v2` monorepo. Astro, fully static, no backend.

The product is a **native iOS/Android app**. This site markets it and hosts the
SEO content. There is no web app here, no auth, and no user accounts.

## Stack (locked)

| | |
|---|---|
| Framework | Astro 7 — static output, MPA |
| Interactivity | None installed — see rule 2 before reaching for React |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` |
| Content | Sanity (guides) + local TS data (bike catalog) |
| Images | `astro:assets` → WebP |
| Package manager | pnpm · Node >= 22.12 |
| TypeScript | **pinned to 6.x** — `astro check` cannot use 7.x (the native compiler drops the programmatic API the language server needs) |

Do not add: `react-router` (routing is file-based), a component library, or any
CSS-in-JS. If you think one is needed, raise it rather than adding it.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # dev server
pnpm build      # static build → dist/
pnpm preview    # serve dist/
pnpm check      # astro check — must be 0 errors before you finish
```

## Layout

```
src/
  pages/        file-based routes; each one prerenders
  layouts/      BaseLayout (html + head/SEO) · ProseLayout (long-form)
  components/
    ui/         .astro — zero JS. Default choice.
    islands/    .tsx — React, hydrated. Exception, not default.
  content/      vendored data layer from myridesg-v2 (see below)
  assets/       images processed by astro:assets
  styles/       global.css — Tailwind entry + @theme tokens
  consts.ts     site config, store URLs, nav
```

## Rules

**1. Every route prerenders.** `output: 'static'`. There is no server at
runtime, so no route may fetch on request. Data is fetched at build time in
frontmatter or a prebuild script.

**2. `.astro` only — React is not installed.** Nothing on the site has ever
needed an island: accordions and menus use `<details>`, the theme toggle is a
dozen lines of inline script, and the phone mockups on the home page are
rendered markup. `@astrojs/react` was emitting a ~190 KB client runtime into
`dist/_astro/` that no page referenced, so it came out.

Put it back only for something that genuinely cannot be done without client
state, and put it back deliberately:

```bash
pnpm add @astrojs/react react react-dom
pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

then re-add `react()` to `astro.config.mjs` and `jsx`/`jsxImportSource` to
`tsconfig.json`. Use `client:visible` unless it must run sooner. Note that the
`feat/demo` branch still has an island (`DemoGarage.tsx`) and needs all of the
above restored before it will build against `main`.

**3. Images go in `src/assets/`, never `public/`.** Only `src/assets/` is
processed by `astro:assets`. Files in `public/` are copied byte-for-byte — a
3 MB hero dropped there is a silent performance regression. Use `<Image>` and
give the LCP image `loading="eager"` + `fetchpriority="high"`.

**4. Brand comes from the monorepo.** Colours and fonts are lifted verbatim from
`myridesg-v2/apps/web/app/(marketing)/` — Barlow + Barlow Condensed, and the
nine-token palette declared on `.page` in `page.module.css`. They live in the
`@theme` block of `src/styles/global.css`. Do not invent brand values. Note
`--color-ember-on-dark` (`#f57c67`): ember is unreadable on black, so dark bands
use the lightened value. Never use it on a light surface.

**5. `src/content/` is vendored.** It mirrors `@myridesg/{domain,data}` from the
monorepo. Keep it in sync; do not refactor it, and do not put presentation
there.

**6. Claim guardrails — do not publish these without current evidence.**
From `myridesg-v2/docs/marketing-site-creative-brief.md`:

- Rider, bike or workshop **counts**
- App-store **ratings** or review counts
- "Verified" workshop claims
- "**Free forever**" (stating current pricing is fine)
- **Real-time** data claims when the feed cadence is not real-time
- **Testimonials** inherited from v1
- Working **booking**, partner rewards or push reminders unless production
  verification confirms them

This matters most when writing marketing copy: it is very easy to generate a
plausible "4,800 riders" and ship a false advertising claim. If a number is
needed and not verifiable, leave it out.

Related: never attach invented ratings or reviews to a **named real business**.

## Known gaps

- `/guides` and `/catalog` are not built yet — blocked on Sanity credentials.
  Both are absent from the nav on purpose; do not link them until they exist.
- The demo garage lives on the `feat/demo` branch, not `main`.
- `src/pages/privacy.astro` and `terms.astro` are ported **verbatim** from v2
  and still describe a *web application*. They need legal review for the native
  pivot. Do not edit legal copy — flag it.
- No og:image yet.
